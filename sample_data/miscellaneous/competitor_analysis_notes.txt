Competitor Analysis Notes — Fleet Emissions Software
Compiled by: Derek (PM)
Date: January 20, 2026

GREENFLEET PRO
- Offers CSV bulk import with smart column mapping
- Has reporting templates for 12 states (we have 0)
- Pricing: per-vehicle, no seasonal adjustment
- Mobile app: basic, no offline mode
- Recently raised $8M Series A, expanding sales team
- Weakness: UI is clunky, analytics are basic
- Note: Two of our prospects mentioned evaluating them

ENVIROTRACK
- Strong onboarding experience — guided wizard, pre-built templates by fleet type
- Average time to first value: reportedly 2 days
- Has Samsara and Geotab integrations built-in
- Reporting: flexible but only federal compliance
- Mobile: offline capable with sync
- Weakness: expensive ($15/vehicle/month vs our $8), no state reporting
- Note: Greenway's CS contact mentioned they're looking at EnviroTrack

CLEARPATH FLEET
- Enterprise-focused, $50K+ annual contracts
- Role-based access controls (the feature our enterprise prospects keep asking for)
- Custom reporting engine with drag-and-drop builder
- Integration marketplace with 20+ connectors
- Weakness: overkill for SMB, long implementation cycles (3-6 months)
- Note: Meridian Transport is also evaluating them

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
- We're competitive on price and core tracking functionality
- We're behind on: onboarding (EnviroTrack), reporting flexibility (ClearPath), integrations (both), bulk setup (GreenFleet)
- Mobile offline is a differentiator opportunity — only EnviroTrack has it
- State-specific reporting is a gap across the market — first mover advantage possible
- Our support response time is becoming a liability vs. competitors who offer faster SLAs
