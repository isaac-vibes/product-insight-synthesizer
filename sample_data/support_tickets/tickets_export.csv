TK-1201,2026-01-03,Cannot generate California compliance report,high,resolved,Greenway Logistics,"We need to submit our Q4 California ARB report by Jan 15 but the platform only generates federal EPA reports. We've been manually reformatting the data in Excel but it's error-prone and time-consuming. Need state-specific templates ASAP."
TK-1205,2026-01-06,Emissions factors appear incorrect for 2025 model year vehicles,critical,open,Pacific Fleet Services,"We noticed the emissions factors for our 2025 Freightliner Cascadias don't match the EPA's published values. The platform shows 1,482 g CO2/mi but the correct value is 1,401 g CO2/mi. This affects our compliance calculations and we cannot submit until this is corrected."
TK-1212,2026-01-10,Bulk vehicle setup request,medium,open,Mountain West Carriers,"We just signed up and need to add 520 vehicles. Adding them one at a time through the UI is going to take forever. Is there a way to import from a spreadsheet? Our fleet data is already in a CSV file."
TK-1218,2026-01-14,Mobile app not working in areas without cell service,medium,open,High Plains Trucking,"Our drivers go through large stretches of Wyoming and Montana with no cell coverage. The app just shows a spinning wheel and then goes blank. Drivers can't log fuel stops or mileage until they get back to town, and by then they've forgotten the details. Can you add offline mode?"
TK-1223,2026-01-17,Report showing blank pages,high,resolved,Acme Corp,"When I try to generate a monthly emissions report for our full fleet (1,200 vehicles), pages 3-7 are completely blank. The first two pages show data for about 200 vehicles and then it just stops. Smaller reports work fine."
TK-1229,2026-01-21,Need different report views for different team members,medium,open,Greenway Logistics,"Our compliance officer needs the detailed regulatory report, our CFO wants a cost-per-mile summary, and our ops managers want route-level data. Right now everyone gets the same data dump. Can we get role-based reporting views?"
TK-1234,2026-01-24,Onboarding documentation unclear,low,resolved,Sierra Nevada Fleet,"The getting started guide doesn't explain how to set up vehicle emission classes. We spent two hours trying to figure out which EPA class our vehicles fall into. Would be helpful to have a lookup tool or at least a reference table."
TK-1241,2026-01-29,Integration with Samsara telematics,medium,open,Meridian Transport,"We use Samsara for all our telematics data including fuel consumption. Currently we're manually entering fuel data into your platform that already exists in Samsara. Is there an integration available? Your sales team mentioned an API but we don't have developers on staff to build a custom integration."
TK-1247,2026-02-01,Support response time complaint,high,open,Pacific Fleet Services,"This is a follow-up to TK-1205 submitted 26 days ago about incorrect emissions factors. We still have not received a resolution. Our compliance deadline is Feb 15 and we cannot submit reports with incorrect data. This is now urgent."
TK-1252,2026-02-04,Mobile app crashes when submitting multiple entries,medium,open,High Plains Trucking,"When our drivers try to submit several fuel log entries at once (usually after coming back into cell range), the app crashes. They lose all the data they entered. This has happened to at least 6 different drivers in the past week."
